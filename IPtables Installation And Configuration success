 Question :  We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apache's port i.e 8081 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.
2. Block incoming port 8081 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.


Solution:  

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i
yum install  -y iptables-services
systemctl start iptables
systemctl enable iptables
systemctl status iptables

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8084 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8084 -j DROP
iptables -L --line-numbers
iptables -R INPUT 5 -p icmp -j REJECT
    
Add below IPtables Rules  for successful task completion 
------------------------------------------------------------
service iptables save 
systemctl restart iptables
systemctl status iptables
curl localhost:8084

Telnet or Curl the Apache port 8084  ( Please check port no as per your task)
    From LB server it should be reachable & accessible
    Whereas  form Jump server it should not be accessible
